# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the app

To run the app in development mode, use the following command in your project's **terminal** (not the browser's web console):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view your application by opening a browser and navigating to the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:9003).
