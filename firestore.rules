/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data (Periods and Transactions) and allows public read access to shared configuration data (settings).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /settings/config: Contains global configuration data (categories, rideApps) that is publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/periods/{periodId}: Stores financial periods specific to each user, with access restricted to the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transactions for each user, with access restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User-specific data (Periods and Transactions) are nested under /users/{userId} to simplify authorization.
 * - Listing of Periods and Transactions is restricted to the owner of the user ID.
 * - The /settings/config collection is publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The user ID is implicitly denormalized by nesting data under the /users/{userId} path.  This avoids the need to store and validate a separate userId field within the Period and Transaction documents.
